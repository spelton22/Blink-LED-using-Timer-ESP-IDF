Build the circuit and write a program to simultaneously blink (toggle) two LEDs using two
separate timers: the built-in LED at every 500 msec and an external LED at every 1 sec. The
expectation is that the togging rate is adjusted via the timer configuration and no explicit
timing-related functions such as delay() are used.
